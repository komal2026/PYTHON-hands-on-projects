"""
1)for idx, q in enumerate(questions, 1):
This line starts a for loop that goes through each item in the list called questions.

questions is a list where each element q is itself a list representing a question.

The enumerate() function adds a counter to the loop:

idx is the counter variable, starting from 1 because of the second argument to enumerate(questions, 1).

q is the current question (a list of question text, options, and correct answer index).

Essentially, this means:
For each question q in questions, do the following, and label it number idx starting from 1

2)print(f"\nQuestion {idx}: {q[0]}")
This prints the current question number and the question text.

f"" means f-string (formatted string) in Python, allowing you to embed variables directly.

\n means a newline, so each question prints with a blank line before it for readability.

q[0] accesses the first element of the question list, which is the text of the question itself.

3)for i, option in enumerate(q[1:5], 1):
This is a nested loop inside the question loop.

q[1:5] slices the question list to get elements from index 1 up to but not including 5.
These correspond to the 4 answer options.

enumerate(..., 1) here:

i is the option number, starting from 1.

option is the actual text of each answer option.

This loop goes through the 4 answer choices for the current question.
4)print(f"{i}) {option}")
This prints each option in a numbered list format.

Again uses an f-string.
